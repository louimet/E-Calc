hi guys,
the section on interviews follows the notes Boulos took during our first meeting.
See you tonight in OS!

Laurent
P.S. I’ll get on git hub now…

-        By Friday January 29, 2016
 
-        List of Questions
-        List of Interviewees
-        Check out GitHub and learn how to use it
 
-        First Deliverable: February 22nd.
§  Initial Set of Persona and use cases
§  Implementation of Use Cases. (show the implementation of the calculator)
§  Testing the implementation vs the use cases.
§  We should have the source code for the calculator.
§  Include all basic functions (will have to see on that later on) + transcendental ones.
 
n  Check what type of accuracy each person needs.
 
 
-        Think of people to interview.
 
o   Decide on whether the clients want it to flip/be usable on phones/tablets.
o   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRXe1omEGWQ&list=PLD4EF3E3AD055F3C7
 
-        Need to have an idea of the users.
-        Choose people we know and other team members will interview them.
-        When designing the GUI make sure to cover as much as possible.
 
Means of communication/Sharing Work
-        Communication: Slack
-        Sharing work: GitHub
 
-        Think of questions to ask
 
 
User Cases:
Primary Actor: Someone that interacts directly with the uses of the software/hardware. They will benefit from the system. It is the potential user of the system.
Secondary Actor: Someone/Something that provides assistance to the system so that it can help the primary actor to achieve its goal. 


INTERVIEWS

POTENTIAL QUESTIONS:

NOTE : certain questions might seem to lead into the design of a vaster app than just a calculator, but I included them nonetheless. They can yield useful information and maybe we can include some ideas in our presentation, though not implement them.

-        Would an online calculator be appealing to you?
o   If yes, what function would be useful if provided? (saving results, formulas, etc. for sharing across platforms/applications)
-        Would you like your calculator to be configurable to a certain extent?
o   Modify number of decimals?
o   Rearrange buttons to your liking?
o   …
-        What precision do you require of your calculator?
o   Number of decimals
-        In what setting do you typically use a calculator?
o   Open question
o   Sample answers : when working on a computer, on the go on my phone, while working on a tablet, etc.
o   Expand : describe the steps of calculator use
§  Ex. : Scroll page, find icon, tap icon, calculate, switch app, plug in number, come back to calculator, do another calculation, switch app again.
-        What do you use your calculator for?
o   E.g. Simple operations or complex calculations
o   Lots of quick operations or long sequences
§  If long sequences : how would you qualify the tracking on your calculator (i.e. display of calculation so far, backtracking options like CTRL-Z, etc.)
-        How satisfied are you with the current calculator you use
o   Provide scale from 1 to 5
o   Maybe separate this question into 2 : Ease of use and Available functions
-        What’s missing from your calculator that you would like to see?
o   Open question
-        Which calculator do you use more often?
o   Type (physical or app, Name of app)
-        Do you still use a physical calculator?
o   If so, what advantages do you think it has over a calculator program or app?
-        Would unit tracking be a useful function?
o   i.e. instead of multiplying 2 x 2 and knowing it’s centimeters, which yields square centimeters, a unit could be attached to each term, i.e. 2 cm x 2 cm, and the calculator would return 4 square centimeters.  Simple example, but can
-        Would a unit converter be a useful addition to your calculator?
o   E.g. convert square meters in square kilometers, or PSI in mmHg of Bar


POTENTIAL INTERVIEWEES:

Name : Stéphane Munger
Age : 37
Occupation : Mechanical Engineer
Uses calculators on a variety of platforms, including PC, laptop, phone, and “hand-attached” iPad.
Contact : Laurent, friend of mine
