##Proposed Structure

So, team, I've put in a three-folder structure where one folder should hold whatever source code we eventually produce, 
another folder for the external documentation (that which is aimed at the users) and another folder for us to keep track of 
the project.

I propose using gitHub's markdown (I guess they don't like markup so they call it markdown, go figure), 
as we can input directly from the browser. It has a bit of a shallow curve but there's really not much to it. 
Files need to end in md in order for the markdown to work. Check out the doc 
[here](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/).

Additionally, so that we keep a relatively sane history of what we're doing, I would suggest to always add a 
relevant comment to commits (at least to the last one in a batch series of commits) so that we know what's going on and we
can backtrack relatively painlessly.
