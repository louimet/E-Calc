Hi guys, 
Here I have compiled all the questions we submitted and arranged them in themes.  I suggest one or more questions for each theme, but only so that it makes a skeleton for our questionnaire.  Numerous sub-questions could apply depending on where a particular interview takes us.  The original questions in each them follow.

Devang, most of your questions relate to our particular transcendental calculator, so they kind of did not fit into the more general categories.  Most are in the functions section (13), but we should definitely have a section that focusses on the particular model we’re building.

Also note that the themes are not ordered.  If I had to suggest an order, I would say something like 1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 10, 11, 12…  7, satisfaction, not sure where to put it…  i even imagine if we ask it at the beginning AND at the end, the answer could vary! :)

Let me know what you think.

1. Persona-related

* Around how many times have you used a calculator in this past week?
* What goals do you have in your profession or business?
* would you be willing to devote some time to learning how to use a new app?


2. Setting
* Describe a typical scenario in which you use your calculator.
* For work or home use? When working on a computer, on the go on my phone, while working on a tablet, etc. 
* EXPAND : Ask the user to provide more details : 
* e.g. time of day, 
* platform used, 
* connected to the internet or not, 
* multitasking or not, 
CONTINGENT EXPANSION - Would using a mobile paired with a computer make sense (eg spreadsheet on comp, calc on device)
* would a typical scenario entail the user already working on said device?
* etc…

3. Current use
* Do you use any particular type of calculator ?
* Which calculator do you use more often? (leave open to see if user emphasizes physical/app category or sci/financial)
* CONTINGENT ORDERING 
*     If you use a physical, what is the unattractive part of an app? (if any)
*     Else, what is the unattractive part of a physical? (if any)
*     If app, what device?
* OR
*     same (sci/graph/tirg/stat)
*     same (brand or name of app)
* Are there existing calculators that are capable of fulfilling your needs? If not, how difficult is it to fulfill these tasks?
* Describe the steps of calculator use Ex. : Scroll page, find icon, tap icon, calculate, switch app, plug in number, come back to calculator, do another calculation, switch app again… etc.

4. Most frequently used function
* What functions on a calculator do you use most?
* What is the most important function in a calculator in relation to your usage/work?
* Which of these functions do/would you use most?
*    sin(x), cos(x), 10^x, π^x, log_e(x) = ln(x), log_10(x),
*    e^x, sinh(x), cosh(x), tanh(x), √x, σ (Standard Deviation), x^y

5. Type of calculation
* SUGGESTED QUESTION : Describe the operations you typically use your calculator for.
* Lots of quick operations?
*  - bear in mind for memory section further down...
* Long, complex calculations?
* if it has tracking, how do you qualify the tracking on your calculator?

6. Memory
* Do you use the memory function of your calculator?
* Are you satisfied with the ease of use of the memory function?
* Are you satisfied with the number of memory slots your calculator provides, or do you often need more?
* Would storing values for sharing with another app be a useful function?

7. Precision/magnitude/abstract-interface
* What level of precision do you require of your calculator?  What order of magnitude do you require?
* How many significant digits would you say are required from your calculator?
* How many digits to the right of the decimal point do you need normally in your work?
* do you need results to be displayed in scientific notation?
* do you need to input scientific notation?
* do you need to input quotients?
* would a quotient result display be desirable to you? (if result is rational)
* would switching between degrees, radians or gradians be useful to you?
* If no, what angle measure do you prefer

8. Functions
* \[Would unit tracking be a useful function?\]
o i.e. instead of multiplying 2 x 2 and knowing it’s centimeters, which yields square centimeters, a unit could be attached to each term, i.e. 2 cm x 2 cm, and the calculator would return 4 square centimeters. 
* \[Would a unit converter be a useful extension to your calculator?\]
* ~~How would a calculator including these 5 transcendental functions help you with your everyday work?~~
* Which of the following functions is most useful to you: sin/cos, 10^x, pi^x, log_n(x), log_10(x), e^x, sinh(x), cosh(x), tanh(x), sqrt(x), Standard Deviation, x^y?
* which would be the least useful?
* If these functions are being used by the user:
* - Can you give examples of where you would typically use these functions?
* - How do you currently go about computing these functions?
* What kind of problems would this calculator help you solve?
* Would you prefer to use a calculator that displays an answer every time you enter a calculation step or a calculator that takes the whole equation and delivers the final answer directly?
* \[If you use graphs, what's more important, graph size or button size?\]
* Are you familiar with different input notations (Polish (prefix), Reverse-Polish (postfix) and infix)
* IF SO, do you have any marked preferences regarding input notation?

9. Customization
* Would you like your calculator to be configurable to a certain extent?
* What would you set to your liking if you had the option?
* Rearrange buttons to your liking?
* Would you prefer a calculator that is capable of switching between simple and complex mode? 
* \[If yes, do you prefer to conduct the switch through clicking an existing icon on the calculator or through other gestures (eg. place the cell phone horizontally)\]
* would the you like to have a trace-back function that allows you to review all answers broken down in steps?
* would you find it usefult to be able to copy and paste specific parts of the tracking?

10. Style
* When you choose a calculator, how much does its functionality influence your choice and how much do its looks influence your choice? (e.g. 30 % looks, 70 % functions)
EXPAND : lots of room here…
* what from the interface influences your choice most? ie. color, font, shape of the icon etc.
* Do you prefer having bigger numbers and smaller operators or the other way around? Or would making everything equal-sized suit your taste best?
* Do you think the equal sign should be bigger that the rest of the buttons?
* Do you think any of the buttons should be colored? If yes which ones? And how would that help you in general?
* Do you consider button real-estate or display real estate more important?
* Does the user consider the available screen size on the mobile device to be sufficient for typical app usage?
* Would a tabbed-button pad be desirable on a smaller device?

11. Platforms
* What platform would you like your calculator to run on?
* Would an online calculator be appealing to you?
EXPAND : What would web connectivity allow you to do?
* \[would sharing accross online apps or platforms be of interest to you?\]
* when you're working on your computer, if you need to use calculator, which option will you chose? a) calculator software installed on your computer b) online calculator c) calculator app on your cell phone?
* Do you think that your colleagues and others in your field would also benefit from a calculator on similar platform?
* If online acces is of interest, would the user consider installing a calculator app on a mobile device?
* Are there any particular apps or pages that the user finds challenging to use given screen-size? Pleasing? 

12. Satisfaction
* SUGGESTED QUESTIONS : On a scale of 1 to 5, how satisfied are you with the ease of use of your current calculator?  
* And, in particular, 1 to 5, how satisfied are you with the available functions?

* What is lacking with existing calculators that you would want to see in our calculator? How would these features help with your work?
* What do you like about existing calculators that you think we should incorporate into our calculator?
* Would tactile feedback make using an app on a mobile device more pleasant?
* If you were faced with two apps that delivered the same, which would you choose from the following? should you have to:
*    slower initialization - faster delivery of calulations afterwards
*        vs
*    faster initialization - slower delivery of calulations afterwards
*
*    larger memory footprint - less cpu consumption
*        vs
