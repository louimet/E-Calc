Hi guys, 
Here I have compiled all the questions we submitted and arranged them in themes.  I suggest one or more questions for each theme, but only so that it makes a skeleton for our questionnaire.  Numerous sub-questions could apply depending on where a particular interview takes us.  The original questions in each them follow.

Devang, most of your questions relate to our particular transcendental calculator, so they kind of did not fit into the more general categories.  Most are in the functions section (13), but we should definitely have a section that focusses on the particular model we’re building.

Also note that the themes are not ordered.  If I had to suggest an order, I would say something like 1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 10, 11, 12…  7, satisfaction, not sure where to put it…  i even imagine if we ask it at the beginning AND at the end, the answer could vary! :)

Let me know what you think.
